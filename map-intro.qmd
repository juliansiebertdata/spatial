In this introduction, I want to Give a brief overview about what is possible With spatial science and R and how we can make meaningful maps with readily available data. In previous sections, we already learned about what spatial data is and how it looks. So now we want to Visualize it. 

Therefore, we will use The packages {tmap}, {ggplot2}, {leaflet} and {mapview} to create static and interactive maps. Simultaneously, we want to explore which kind of maps are commonly used In spatial science and how we can create them with the tools available to us.

## Kind of Maps

There are several different Maptypes we can choose to visualize our data. The most common ones are:
 - [Choropleth Maps](https://r-graph-gallery.com/choropleth-map.html)
 - [Hexbin Maps](https://r-graph-gallery.com/hexbin-map.html)
 - [Cartograms](https://r-graph-gallery.com/cartogram.html)
 - [Flow Maps](https://r-graph-gallery.com/connection-map.html)
 - [Bubble Maps](https://r-graph-gallery.com/bubble-map.html)

Following we will explore how to create these maps with R.

### Hexagon / Hexbin Maps

With the code [here](https://github.com/BjnNowak/TidyTuesday/blob/main/SC_AnimalFarms_Bivariate.R)

- [frex package](https://github.com/BjnNowak/frex) and video below!
- Uber Hexbin Package (see video below)

### Bubble Maps

With the code [here](https://github.com/BjnNowak/TidyTuesday/blob/main/SC_GreenCountry_Europe.R) 

- [bertin](https://github.com/BjnNowak/bertin) package to make valued bubble maps from raster files.

### R for GIS and Mapping

## Leaflet

### leafdrop

Maybe (dont know if its still online) https://github.com/r-spatial/leafpop to add tables and graphs to popups in a map.
